The data used in the paper to compute business cycle statistics is in data_cycle_is_trend.xls
 
Programs:  A guide to the programs can be found in program_notes.pdf
 
The main programs are:  environment.m solve_uhlig.m calculate_moments.m key_moments.m
 
These programs map the model’s parameters into theoretical moments (which we then matched to the empirical moments using standard GMM techniques). 
 
The programs use Harald Uhlig’s toolkit to solve the log-linearized model, which can be found here: www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/wpol/html/toolkit.htm.
